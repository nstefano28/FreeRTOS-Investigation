# Device Drivers and I/O

FreeRTOS provides a framework for integrating device drivers and handling I/O operations in embedded systems. It offers a set of APIs and patterns to enable efficient and safe interaction with hardware peripherals.

## Device Driver Model
FreeRTOS does not provide a complete device driver model like in general-purpose OS.

However, FreeRTOS offers a set of libraries and utilities to simplify common I/O operations:
- **FreeRTOS+IO**: A library that provides a consistent interface for accessing common I/O devices like serial ports, ADCs, and GPIOs [1].
- **FreeRTOS+FAT**: A thread-safe FAT file system library for storage devices like SD cards and eMMC [2].
- **FreeRTOS+CLI**: A library for creating command-line interfaces [3].

These libraries build upon the core FreeRTOS primitives to provide higher-level abstractions for device I/O.

## I/O Operations
FreeRTOS provides a set of API functions for performing I/O operations on devices [4]:

- `FreeRTOS_open()`: Opens a device for input/output operations. 
- `FreeRTOS_read()`: Reads data from an opened device. 
- `FreeRTOS_write()`: Writes data to an opened device. 
- `FreeRTOS_ioctl()`: Sends control commands to a device.

These APIs allow tasks to interact with devices in a synchronized and deterministic manner.


## Differences from General-Purpose OS
FreeRTOS device driver and I/O handling differ from general-purpose OS in several aspects:
- No unified device driver model or framework
- Reliance on hardware-specific libraries
- Lightweight and deterministic I/O operations

Embedded systems uses vary greatly, so device drivers are often tied to the specific hardware platform and application requirements.
