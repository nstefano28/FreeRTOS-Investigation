# Target Platforms and Use Cases

FreeRTOS is designed to run on microcontrollers and small embedded systems with limited memory and processing power. It supports a wide range of architectures, including ARM Cortex-M, Xtensa, RISC-V, and more [1].

## Characteristics of FreeRTOS Target Platforms

FreeRTOS target platforms share the following characteristics [2]:

- **Low-power, battery-operated devices**: FreeRTOS is designed to be power-efficient, making it suitable for devices that have strict power consumption requirements.

- **Limited memory and processing power**: FreeRTOS has a small memory footprint and is optimized to run on microcontrollers with limited RAM and flash memory.

- **Real-time constraints and deterministic behavior**: FreeRTOS enables embedded systems to meet strict timing requirements and respond to events predictably.

- **Connectivity through various protocols**: FreeRTOS supports a range of connectivity options, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and low-power wireless protocols like Zigbee and Thread, allowing embedded devices to communicate and interact with other systems.

## Example Use Cases for FreeRTOS

FreeRTOS is widely used in various embedded applications, such as [3]:

1. **IoT sensors and actuators**: FreeRTOS enables the development of low-power, connected sensors and actuators for IoT applications, such as environmental monitoring, smart homes, and industrial automation.

2. **Wearable devices**: FreeRTOS is used in wearable devices like fitness trackers and smartwatches, where power efficiency, real-time performance, and connectivity are strict requirements.

3. **Industrial control systems**: FreeRTOS is used in industrial control systems to ensure reliable and deterministic operation in factory automation and process control applications.

4. **Medical devices**: FreeRTOS is used in medical devices where real-time performance, safety, and reliability are necessary.

These platforms differ from laptops and desktops in terms of resource constraints, real-time requirements, and specialized peripherals.
