# Networking

FreeRTOS provides networking capabilities through its FreeRTOS+TCP library, which is a portable, open-source TCP/IP stack designed for embedded systems [1]. FreeRTOS+TCP allows embedded devices to communicate over IP networks using standard protocols like TCP, UDP, and HTTP.

## FreeRTOS+TCP Features
FreeRTOS+TCP offers the following key features [1]:
- Supports IPv4 and IPv6 protocols
- Implements TCP, UDP, ICMP, and DHCP protocols
- Provides a Berkeley sockets-like API for network programming
- Supports multiple network interfaces and concurrent connections
- Includes optional add-ons like HTTP, FTP, and MQTT clients
- Configurable memory footprint and network buffer management

FreeRTOS+TCP is designed to be modular and easily integrated into existing FreeRTOS-based projects, enabling networked communication for embedded devices.
