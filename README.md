# FreeRTOS Technical Analysis 

## Introduction

FreeRTOS is a popular open-source real-time operating system designed for embedded systems and microcontrollers. It provides a small and efficient multitasking kernel that supports a wide range of architectures and development tools. FreeRTOS is widely used in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, automotive systems, medical equipment, industrial automation, and consumer electronics.

This analysis explores the core OS components and features of FreeRTOS through the lens of the three pillars of operating systems: virtualization, concurrency, and persistence.
